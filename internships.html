                        As a <b>mechanical design intern</b>, I designed and supported the manufacturing of 13 unique structures, 4 original mechanisms, and numerous custom parts for a robotic welding cell. 
                        The video shows a 3D model (designed in Solidworks) of this robotic welding cell.
                        I created part and assembly drawings and closely facilitated in-house and external manufacturing. 
                        This project also exposed me to a variety of OTS components commonly used in industrial automation (pneumatic grippers and cylinders, light curtains, keyence safety scanners, locator pins, saginaw doors, to name a few). 
                        It was a creative and challenging experience that I enjoyed immensely. I touched virtually every aspect of this welding cell, and today it is installed and running at QuickStart in Savannah, GA.

                        As an intern in the <b>Modeling, Simulation, and Analysis</b> (MSA) group, 
                        I developed a MATLAB-based visualization tool to streamline the analysis of weapon performance from 6-DOF simulation data.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This tool took raw flight simulation data and displayed it in a user-friendly GUI, enabling engineers to quickly interpret and assess simulation performance.
                        It was then integrated into an existing toolsuite, helping to consolidate multiple standalone tools and significantly reducing engineers' troubleshooting time.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Ultimately, I completed this project <i>weeks</i> ahead of schedule and was selected to present my work to the MSA group director.
                        I was consequently awarded the <em>RStars Accountability Award</em>, which is given to interns who demonstrate exceptional performance and accountability.
                        This internship was a challenging and growth-filled experience that I am grateful for and very proud of. Image credit: <a href="https://www.rtx.com", target="_blank">RTX</a>

                        As a <b>Software/Data Engineering Intern</b> at Kreatize, I was tasked with evaluating the usability of a commercial software tool for improving manufacturing time/cost estimations.
                        To do so, I developed a Python script to implement that commercial software into the company workflow using REST API and collected experimental data to evaluate its effectiveness.
                        This project was a great opportunity to learn about REST API, SQL, and data analysis, and I was able to provide valuable insights to the company about the software's usability.
